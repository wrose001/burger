1) Deploy this base app to heroku
    - Once you get it working as-is then you know you can successfully connect to remote database

2) Work on earch route 1 by 1

    Backend
    - GET
    - POST
    - UPDATE

    Consider hardcoding some stuff here to eliminate any noise.
    e.g. Hardcode your request body handle your POST and PUT

3) Frontend
    - Remove hardcoded stuff from Backend
    - Now wire up the front end and ensure your jquery ajax is hitting the appropriate route endpoints and sending the correct information in the request body
